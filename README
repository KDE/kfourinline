GENERAL NOTE:

  This is a small KDE 2.0 game, I wrote to practise 
  programming in KDE. 
  It should work quite stable. But if you find any bugs
  please contact me. 
  It would be also nice to give me some general feedback
  about the program, so that it can be approved or it
  can be considered in other programs.
